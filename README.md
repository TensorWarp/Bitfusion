# üöÄ Sparsely Deep Learning Project

**Bitfusion** is an innovative and experimental project at the intersection of deep learning (AI), C++, and CUDA. This project is dedicated to advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a unique focus on sparsity.

## üåü Overview

The Sparsely Deep Learning Project is a dynamic exploration of deep learning's synergies with C++ and CUDA. Our primary emphasis is on NLP, where we introduce an approach that incorporates sparsity as a fundamental aspect. In this context, sparsity refers to the deliberate introduction of sparse structures or patterns within neural networks to optimize performance and efficiency. Over time, we also integrate other experimental features, such as an API with Mojo, a new language from the Modular team.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

### Visual Studio 2022

1. Install Visual Studio 2022, HIP SDK, CUDA Toolkit, and other dependencies.
2. Open the project solution file `bitfusion.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
